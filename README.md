## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Cannot connect to device:**
1. Verify the IP address: `ping 10.8.11.30`
2. Check the radio is powered on (not just standby)
3. Verify the PIN (usually `1234`, check radio settings)
4. Ensure port `80` is not blocked by firewall

### Presets Not Showing

1. Make sure you have presets saved on the radio
2. Switch to Internet Radio mode on the radio
3. Click the **Refresh Presets** button
4. Check Home Assistant logs for errors

### Commands Not Working

1. Ensure radio is fully powered on (not standby)
2. Some commands only work in specific modes (e.g., pause doesn't work for streaming radio)
3. Check the integration logs in Home Assistant

### Finding Your Radio's IP Address

**Option 1: Router**
- Log into your router
- Look for "Frontier Silicon", "Homerton", or your radio's name
- Note the IP address

**Option 2: Radio Display**
- Go to radio's settings menu
- Navigate to Network → Network Settings
- View IP address

**Option 3: Network Scan**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24 | grep -B2 "Frontier\|Homerton"

# Or use an app like Fing on your phone
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Static IP (Recommended)

Set a static IP for your radio in your router's DHCP settings to prevent the IP from changing.

### Custom Port

If your radio uses a non-standard port (rare), specify it during setup.

### Multiple Radios

You can add multiple Frontier Silicon radios! Each will get its own set of entities:
- `media_player.homerton_2`
- `media_player.roberts_stream_94i`
- etc.

## Supported Devices

This integration works with **any device using the Frontier Silicon platform**, including:

### Majority
- Homerton (all models)
- Oakington
- Peterhouse
- Willingham

### Roberts
- Stream series (93i, 94i, 218, etc.)
- Revival series

### Hama
- IR series
- DIR series

### Other Brands

**How to check:** If your radio has the Frontier Silicon chipset and exposes an API at `http://[IP]/fsapi`, it will work!
